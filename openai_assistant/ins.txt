apitomysql_ETL.ipynb
work: - Data Collection and Transformation from API, Data Ingestion into MySQL Database

app.py file
work: - The provided Python script is designed for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) operations on a MySQL database. The script is divided into three main functions
	1. Extraction Function (extract_data):
	2. Transformation Function (transform_data):
	3. Loading Function (load_data):

assignment_ETL.ipynb
work:- Run the ETL process, Extract bank and market cap data from the JSON file, Transform the market cap currency using the exchange rate data, Load the transformed data into a seperate CSV

clan_ETL.ipynb file
work:- Data Cleanup and Analysis Code

DataFrame_ETL.ipynb file
work:- Extract CSVs into DataFrame, Transform DataFrames, Load DataFrames into Database, Confirm data has been added by querying the Top150 table
	   
etl_1.py file 
work:- This Python script leverages PySpark to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations on data processing, storing the results in a specified output location, likely an AWS S3 bucket
	1. Configuration and Environment Setup:
	2. Spark Session Initialization:
	3. Data Processing (process_song_data):
	4. Log Data Processing (process_log_data):
	5. Main Function (main):
	6. Script Execution (`if name == "main":):

ETL_crowdfunding.ipynb
work:- Import the file into a DataFrame, Iterate through the DataFrame and convert each row to a dictionary, Iterate through each dictionary and do the following, Extract the dictionary values from the keys using Python list comprehension, Add the values for each row to a new list. Create a new DataFrame with the retrieved data.Export the DataFrame.Transform and Clean Data.Check the data types of the columns and convert column to an integer.Split columns in the DataFrame. 
Drop the column in the DataFrame.

etl_googlesheet.py
work:-  Python file implements an ETL job using pandas for data manipulation and the Google Sheets API v4 for writing results to a Google Sheet

ETL_imdb.ipynb
work:- Pandas for Data Clean-up, Import SQL-Alchemy for SQL-Lite Data Load, Create Engine & Connection to SQL Lite DB, Create Template and Load Data from Python to SQL Lite DB

etl-latest.ipynb file
work:- ETL process for each of tables before completing load the whole datasets.

etl_runtime_analysis.ipynb

ETL_telecom.ipynb
work:- Create SparkSession,Loading the datasets, Spark SQL
	
PySpark_ETL.py
work:- The given Python code defines a PySpark_ETL class for ETL operations using PySpark and MySQL. It initializes a Spark session, reads data from an IBM AS/400 database, executes a SQL query, and writes the result to a MySQL table. Key methods include DB_reader for data reading, Query_Executer for executing a SQL query, and Query_Writer for writing data to MySQL.

spark_etl.py file
work:- This Python script is a Spark ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing and analyzing data. the PySpark library for working with large-scale distributed data processing.
